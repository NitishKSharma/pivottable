# PivotTable.js

PivotTable.js is a Javascript Pivot Table library with drag'n'drop functionality built on top of jQuery/jQueryUI and originally written in CoffeeScript by [Nicolas Kruchten](http://nicolas.kruchten.com) at [Datacratic](http://datacratic.com). 

It is available under an MIT license from [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/pivottable) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pivottable) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) under the name `pivottable`.

PivotTable.js can be used with [Python/Jupyter](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pivottablejs) and [R/RStudio](https://github.com/smartinsightsfromdata/rpivotTable) and you can [try it right now](http://nicolas.kruchten.com/pivottable/examples/local.html) in your browser on a CSV file.

## What does it do?

PivotTable.js' basic function is to enable data exploration and analysis by turning a data set into a summary table and then optionally adding a true 2-d drag'n'drop UI to allow a user to manipulate this summary table, turning it into a pivot table, very similar to the one found in older versions of Microsoft Excel with a bunch of extra developer-oriented features and some visualization effects. With [optional add-ons](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/wiki/Optional-Extra-Renderers), the summary table can be rendered as various kinds of charts, turning the pivot table into a pivot chart.

# PivotTable (pivot.js) with bootstrap styling

This is based on [Nicholas' pivottable.js] (https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable) but uses bootstrap styling. It uses variables on the html page to pass on the values to pivot.js
Basically, we have just updated three files:
* pivot.js: to accomodate new bootstrap variables and new styling
* pivot.css: new styling which is streamlined with bootstrap and other new stlyling attributes
* mps_csv.html: the only example I've updated to show the new changes

Our changes are live on mps_csv.html file which you can see by clicking on "pivotUI() with C3 chart renderers" example from the homepage. We've not tested with the other renderers so far but I am hopeful it will work with other renderers as well. For some it might require a little update.
